**Day #31 of #100DaysOfCode @ApacheKafka**
Today I spent time understanding the effect of using the below attributes in the Producer application with respect to delivering the messages in batches to the topic(partitions) in Kafka brokers.
-	Producer configuration: linger.ms=<t in ms>
-	Producer configuration: batch.size=<n in bytes>
The Producer delivers the messages in batches, the number of messages delivered in the batch depends upon whichever happens first
1.	Batch size - cumulative size of the consecutive messages being added to the batch until it reaches the value mentioned in the batch.size
2.	Batch duration â€“ Time duration specified in linger.ms until which the producer queues up the messages produced.

**Day #32 of #100DaysOfCode @ApacheKafka**
Today while creating a python script to be run in a Linux environment (typically when working on an edge node or nodes of a cluster) I realized that we have to constantly remember the below, especially developers who often switch between working on windows and Linux operating systems.
-	Include the python installation directory as first line of the script - #!/usr/bin/env python
-	To run the script from the shell - ./filename.py

**Day #33 of #100DaysOfCode @ApacheKafka**
Today I started modifying the mock card transaction helper module python file to perform the following changes.
-	Create different type of card providers for the mock card transactions we are trying to generate for the client application.
-	Instead of capturing the full description of the card provider (provided by the credit_card_provider method of faker class)
-	Assign the card provider to the Key of the message sent to Kafka topic.

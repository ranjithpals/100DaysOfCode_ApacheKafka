# World is full of imperfections
# World is meant to be so, so we cannot always be in pursuit of perfections
# Instead we should be looking for imperfections within us which will help us navigate through these imperfections
# Goloka is the ultimate goal and navigating through this world with help of a spiritual guru should be our goal.
# We have to bear with the pain world puts you through, world is not goloka, we are here to suffer, suffering is gauranteed.
# Be the change you want to see in your family, society or any other person in this world
# Need to inculcate the quality to face criticism, inability to face criticism and impatience leads to troubled times in adulthood.
# Need to inculcate the same qualities in kids as well, need to be humble and stable in times of criticism and applauds.

**Run a Producer or Consumer script from CLI (Linux Terminal/WSL)** \
https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/apache-kafka/consumers-hands-on/ \
Ensure that Python 3, pip, and virtualenv are installed on your machine. If theyâ€™re not, check out the prerequisites from the getting started with Python guide. \
From a terminal window, activate a new virtual environment and install the confluent-kafka library. \
$ virtualenv env \
$ source env/bin/activate \
$ pip install confluent-kafka \

Determine your cluster endpoint by running: \
$ confluent kafka cluster describe

You need an API key and secret in order to proceed. If you need a new one, make note of the cluster ID that was printed in step 3 and use it to run: \
confluent api-key create --resource {ID} \
Then set the key using: \
confluent api-key use {API Key} --resource {ID} \

Make the script executable and run: \
chmod u+x consumer.py \
./consumer.py config.ini

# 100DaysOfCode_ApacheKafka
#100daysofcode challenge - Confluent Kafka challenge which I believe  will be an exciting journey into the world of Apache Kafka with Confluent!

I am taking this challenge for the following important reasons.

# Habit - By committing to this challenge I want to make coding a habit which will bring about a change to my life as any habit would do.
# Accountability - Make myself accountable to post updates on a daily basis and ensure I do not break the habit.
# Inspiration - There have been few friends and mentors in Linkedin who have inspired me to take this challenge and possibly by the end of this challenge I wish I inspire few others.
# Real-Time event based Projects - Would love to Identify problems which would need Real-time event based  Engineering solutions, and work on solving them.
